- A spool of PLA filament (1Kg)
I choose beige as the main color and black for the LCD bezel, because I wanted to achieve that retro look, but you can go with any color, that's on you.
1Kg of filament should be enough to print the whole thing, at least for the main color.

- Threaded inserts for 3D prints
That's not absolutely necessary, but I love those things. They look neat, and they are very practical.

- Superglue

- Some wires for the cabling (22AWG or similar size)

- 2 retro style push buttons
I found them on Aliexpress, this is the description:
16mm LED Illuminuted Push Button Switch 12/24/220V Momentary Self-locking on Off with Light Square Round Rectangle Power Switch

- 1 toggle switch

- Power supply + Voltage Regulator
I decided to run everything at 9V, since I couldn't find a 9V adapter with at least 3A, I opted for a 12V 5A external power supply and an internal 9V 5A regulator.

- A 2,1mm female power jack
- 2x 2,1mm male power jack

- 8 inch 4:3 VGA LCD Screen
Found this on Aliexpress also, it's very important that the size of the LCD panel is 183x141mm or it won't fit the bezel.
